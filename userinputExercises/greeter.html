    <h3>Please input your name into the box:</h3>
    
    <input id="devName" onfocus="devName.value=''"></input>
    <button onclick="devHello()">Enter</button>
    <p>Some short comments; I made it so the input field will 
        clear once it is focused on again.
        This makes the program easier for the user as 
        they don't have to delete what they 
        have already written </p>
